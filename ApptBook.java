/******************************************************************************
 * An ApptBook ("book" for short) is a sequence of Appointment objects in sorted
 * order. The book can have a special "current element," which is specified and
 * accessed through four methods that are available in the this class (start,
 * getCurrent, advance and isCurrent).
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The capacity of a book can change after it's created, but the maximum
 * capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the machine. The
 * constructor, insert, insertAll, and clone methods will result in an
 * {@link java.lang.OutOfMemoryError} when free memory is exhausted.
 * <li>A book's capacity cannot exceed the maximum integer 2,147,483,647
 * ({@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}). Any attempt to create a larger capacity results
 * in a failure due to an arithmetic overflow.
 * </ol>
 * <b>NB</b>: Neither of these conditions require any work for the implementors
 * (students).
