# -Implementation-of-ApptBook-Abstract-Data-Type-ADT-for-Managing-Appointments

• Implemented the ApptBook ADT as a sequence of appointments, building upon previously implemented ADTs.
• Designed the Appointment ADT to represent an entry for a calendar, including a period of time and a description of the activity.
• Ensured the immutability of the Appointment ADT and implemented comparison methods for ordering appointments.
• Developed the ApptBook ADT, a variant of the Sequence ADT, to maintain appointments in order and introduce a new
setCurrent method.
• Replaced Sequence ADT methods with appropriate modifications, such as insert instead of addBefore and addAfter, and
• Restricted the use of null appointment values to prevent potential crashes in the compareTo method.
• Implemented invariants and assertions to maintain the integrity of the ApptBook ADT and validate its state.
• Followed best practices for coding, avoiding the use of System.arrayCopy and opting for "for" loops for clarity.
• Utilized JUnit test cases (TestApptBook.java) to validate the correctness and functionality of the implemented ADT.
• Ensured frequent commits to showcase progress and maintain version control.
